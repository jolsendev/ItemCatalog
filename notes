Project Overview
-----------------
You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user
registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

Why This Project?
Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but
deep down, it’s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data. In this project, you’ll combine your
knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a
compelling service to your users.

What Will I Learn?
You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing
third-party OAuth authentication. You will then learn when to properly use the various HTTP methods available to you
and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

How Does This Help My Career?
Efficiently interacting with data is the backbone upon which performant web applications are built
Properly implementing authentication mechanisms and appropriately mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations are core
features of a properly secured web application

How will I complete this project?
This project is connected to the Full Stack Foundations and Authentication and Authorization courses, but depending on
your background knowledge you may not need the entirety of both courses to complete this project. Here's what you
should do:

Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm
Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)
Write your Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to
/vagrant/catalog within the VM).

Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)
Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally
Get started with this helpful guide.
